    "<hr>\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we will write some advanced SQL queries to obtain some data from the Australian Open Tennis Tournament Database*. We will first provide the background required to understand how the database is structured and then start with the queries.\n",
    "## Background Information\n",
    "### TOURNAMENT RULES\n",
    "#### GAME\n",
    "A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. The\n",
    "running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero\n",
    "to three points are described as \"0\", \"15\", \"30\", and \"40\", respectively. A game is won by\n",
    "the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than\n",
    "the opponent. If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the\n",
    "player's scores equal at forty apiece, the score is not called out as \"forty-forty\", but\n",
    "rather as \"deuce\". If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has\n",
    "one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is \"advantage\" for the player in\n",
    "the lead. If the same player also wins the next point, that player wins the “Game”; if the\n",
    "opposing player wins the next point, the score is again “Deuce”. A player needs to win\n",
    "two consecutive points immediately after “Deuce” to win the “Game”.\n",
    "#### SET\n",
    "A set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games,\n",
    "ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria. Typically, a player wins a\n",
    "set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. If one\n",
    "player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played. If the\n",
    "leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins the\n",
    "game, the set score becomes 6-6 and a tie-break is played. A tie-break allows one player\n",
    "to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7–6.\n",
    "#### MATCH \n",
    "A match consists of a sequence of 3 sets for women. The outcome is determined through a best of three sets system. In other words, if a player wins 2 sets, she wins the match.\n",
    "### Relational Database\n",
    "The [database file](https://github.com/Mo-Saif/SQL-Notebook/blob/master/AusOpen.db?raw=true) used in this notebook is made with SQLite and it has the following design:\n",
